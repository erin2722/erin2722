### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Erin McNulty (she/hers) and I am a full stack developer and a student at Columbia University.

ðŸ”§ Though I got my start as a web programmer, I have recently been excited about systems programming, particularly distrbuted systems. I also have experience with database systems.
