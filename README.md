### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Erin McNulty (she/hers) and I am a full stack developer and a student at Columbia University. I will be starting as a full-time software engineer at MongoDB on their service architecture team in Fall 2023.

ðŸ“š I am a student at Columbia University studying Computer Science and History.

ðŸ’» I was a Software Engineering Intern at MongoDB in 2021 and 2022, a Summer 2020 Major League Hacking Fellow, and a 2020 hackNY Fellow.

ðŸ’­ I have experience ideating, designing, and building products and features from end to end.

ðŸ”§ Though I got my start as a web programmer, I have recently been excited about systems programming, particularly database systems.
